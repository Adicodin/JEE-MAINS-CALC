# JEE MAINS MARKS CALCULATOR

The Joint Entrance Exam for engineering in India gave us two documents after 1 week of our exams:

1. Answer key = Document with Correct answer for each question given in Question id and correct option id pair.
2. Question status = Document with question id, all options id and option id which we had chosen in exam.
.

For calculating marks we have to tally the question id, our option id and correct answer id from both these documents simultaneously.

This was becoming very tedious for me thats why I wrote a code which would do the following things:

1. Tally both the documents
2. Calculate my marks in each subject and print it.
3. Create an excel sheet having each question with its question number, correct ans and option, status (if question was answered or not) and marks alloted to each question (+ve, -ve, 0) which made my job much easier to analyse my mistakes in that paper.
.

It saved a lot of time, calculated my marks in one click and provided a detailed sheet of every question status for both numeric type and MCQs.
